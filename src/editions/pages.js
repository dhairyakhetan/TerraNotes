// Pages an edition draws its own way, for a month that wants more than a new look.js: its own home page and/or article
// page, per layout. Start from a copy of the shared one (src/web/WebHome.jsx, src/phone/PhoneHome.jsx,
// src/web/WebArticle.jsx, src/phone/PhoneArticle.jsx) kept in the edition's folder, e.g. src/editions/oct26/WebHome.jsx,
// and list it here. Anything not listed uses the shared page. They read the edition with useEdition() like the shared
// ones. Kept apart from index.js: the build reads the editions' data in Node, which can't load components.

//               and ends in a "more soon" slot (web/WebArticleLine.jsx)
//     wordsRow: the web words game puts the cloud and its answers side by side, centred on each other
//               (shared/WordsGameSection.jsx)
